"""Client adapters: render the canon into each LLM client's native bootstrap.

The canon is the single source of truth. Rather than hand-maintain a bootstrap
for Claude, Gemini, Codex, and Antigravity, we generate a thin shim for each that
points every conversation at the same engine: start with ``laplace_orient``,
execute via ``laplace_skill`` / ``laplace_run``, verify via ``laplace_verify``.

This keeps the Laplace Engine the default across all the user's LLMs while the
real content lives in one place.

Drive every non-trivial task through the Laplace Engine MCP:

1. **orient** - call `laplace_orient(goal=...)` first. It returns the relevant
   canon: the global foundation (voice, workflow, operations), the active
   domain's axioms and project state, and the candidate skills for your action.
2. **execute** - call `laplace_skill(name)` for a protocol, or `laplace_run(skill,
   target)` to run its backing script. This is the local action.
3. **verify** - call `laplace_verify(target)` to check consistency (epistemic,
   voice, crossref). A failing report means re-orient; do not present unverified work.

Record friction with `laplace_log(skill, signal)`. The canon refines itself
between sessions via `laplace_dream` based on measured skill fitness.

Global foundation always available:
