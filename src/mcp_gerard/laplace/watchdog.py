"""Tool-level watchdog: no laplace_* handler may hang its caller indefinitely.

The engine is a single-process stdio server. A handler that blocks - a wedged
subprocess, a deadlocked pipe, a daemon that inherited a handle - blocks the
*caller* with no recourse, because the MCP client only sees a tool that never
returns. That is the structural defect: a tool able to hang the caller forever.

``guard`` runs the real work on a daemon worker thread and waits at most
``timeout`` seconds for it. If the work overruns, the engine returns a clean,
structured timeout dict and abandons the thread rather than blocking. Python
cannot force-kill a thread, but every blocking call the handlers make is itself
bounded (a backing ``script timeout<=110``, an explicit canon push ``timeout``),
so the abandoned worker unwinds on its own; the daemon flag keeps it from
holding process exit.

The hot-path git that originally motivated this - the fsmonitor pipe deadlock -
is gone: versioning is now pure-Python Dulwich (see gitio), which spawns no
subprocess. The watchdog remains the umbrella that keeps the engine honest under
*any* blocking fault: a wedged backing script, the one explicit ``git push``, or
a pathological filesystem.
