"""Endogenous assessment: the selection operator.

Turns the telemetry ledger into per-skill *fitness* and evidence-gated lifecycle
recommendations (experimental -> core -> deprecated). This is what lets the
dreamer act with silent autonomy safely: it never promotes by fiat, only on
measured evidence of use and good outcomes.

Fitness combines four signals:
  usage      - how often the skill is actually exercised
  quality    - did its verify checks pass / did its script run ok
  feedback   - explicit +/- signals logged against it
  retention  - did its contributions survive (default neutral until observed)
